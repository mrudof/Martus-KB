                                    <p>Named after the Greek word for witness, the Martus Project provides an efficient and secure way to store and retrieve information about human rights abuses. Using the Martus application, you can create records of human rights abuses, attach supporting documents, and store the information on a secure server. Martus encrypts data directly on your computer, and sends this data in an encrypted form to a secure server when you have an internet connection. To learn more about the problems the Martus Project addresses, how Martus is being used throughout the world to securely collect and store sensitive data, and future plans for the project, visit <a href="http://benetech.org/our-programs/human-rights/" target="_blank">http://benetech.org/our-programs/human-rights/</a>.</p>

                                                <li>Martus does not replace direct, immediate communication. You should look into secure options such as encrypted SMS, encrypted messaging systems, secure options for email etc.</li>
                                                <li>Martus can only protect the data entered into the system, if you will be working locally in other programs (Word, Excel etc.) you should consider encrypting those files or full disk encryption.</li>
                                                <li>Martus is only as secure as your device. You should be sure to protect your device from malware as well as maintain passwords on your mobile phone and SIM.</li>
                                                <li>Martus does not enable real-time collaboration between users, like Google Docs does.</li>
                                                <li>Martus is not an efficient replacement for filesharing or syncing services like Dropbox or Google Drive.</li>
                                                <li>Martus does not allow for remote login from any computer or through a web browser. Your account’s private key must be present and the Martus desktop client must be installed on the computer you are using to access your account.</li>

                                <h2 class="section-title">How does Martus keep the data secure?</h2>
                                <div class="section-block">
                                    <p>Every Martus account has a key which can only be accessed using the password for that account. When you sign in to the Martus software, your password enables the application to open the key (associated with the MartusKeyPair.dat file,) so that you can see the records you’ve created and stored.</p><p>Your password is yours alone; without it, no one can open the records you’ve sent to the server, or any of the records on your hard drive. However, if you’ve opted to share records with a Contact, the Contact account holder will be able to see the data that you sent to the server.</p>Information secured with Martus is also protected from being modified by others and the software ensures that no one can create false or inaccurate records using your account. Even if your computer is lost, seized, or stolen, Martus ensures that data entered into Martus records cannot be read by those without permission to access the data.</p>A Martus server is a computer server that accepts encrypted records, securely backs them up, and replicates them to multiple locations, safeguarding the information from loss. (Benetech provides the server software to the organizations that host Martus servers, but it does not host Martus backup servers directly; e-mail <a href="mailto:info@martus.org" target="_blank">martus@benetech.org</a> for a list of potential server hosts.) Any records you haven’t sent to a server exist only on your computer. If your computer is lost, stolen, or damaged, you could lose all of that data. The server acts as a backup mechanism, so the data entered into Martus can be recovered if you lose access to your computer. With your key and your username and password, you can install Martus on a different computer and access all the private data in records you sent to the server. And if you have set up any Contact accounts to receive records from you, sending records to the server makes them available to those accounts.

                                    <p>Independent programmers can review the code in an open source application in a way that they cannot in traditional applications. Benetech has developed Martus for use by human rights organizations, and it has not included any hidden means of collecting information from Martus users, or of having the application perform any hidden tasks. Because Martus is an open source application, you don’t have to take our word for it. Any organization can have the code independently verified to see that it does what we say it will do.</p>

                                    <p>The people who give you information about human rights abuses are concerned about security and privacy—and you need to be just as concerned in order to protect them and yourself.</p>
                                    <p>Increasing access to technology (phones, internet, and social media) increases risks in this digital arena.  Digital security has consequences for physical security.</p>
                                    <p>Tools like Martus should be part of a security culture you establish and practice to keep yourself and your network safe. For more details on security culture and digital security considerations see our Digital Security PPT.</p>
